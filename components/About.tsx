        I’m currently working on this full-stack application built with TypeScript, React,
         and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. Once the frontend is complete, 
         I’ll develop the backend using REST APIs, Node.js with Express, and Supabase for the database and authentication.
         Finally, I plan to bundle the app for mobile with React Native, where additional native features will be integrated later on.
